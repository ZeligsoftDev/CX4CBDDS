# In the following several patterns, the following arguments are defined.
# Some patterns do not use all of these arguments.
#
# 0 - the element that violated the constraint
# 1 - the property of the element that has the wrong cardinality
# 2 - the property's cardinality
# 3 - the minimal cardinality of the property (optional)
# 4 - the maximal cardinality of the property (optional)
#
ZDLMultiplicityConstraint_between={0} property {1} cardinality is {2}; must be between {3} and {4}
ZDLMultiplicityConstraint_less={0} property {1} cardinality is {2}; must not be more than {4}
ZDLMultiplicityConstraint_more={0} property {1} cardinality is {2}; must not be less than {3}
ZDLMultiplicityConstraint_exact={0} property {1} cardinality is {2}; must be exactly {3}
ZDLMultiplicityConstraint_required={0} property {1} is required but has no value.
