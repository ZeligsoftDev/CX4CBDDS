Ant integration with xml-commons resolver.

<p>These classes enhance the <code>&lt;xmlcatalog&gt;</code> datatype
to support external catalog files using the xml-commons resolver, in
accordance with the
<a href="https://oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html">
OASIS "Open Catalog" standard</a>.  They will be used if and only if
the xml-commons resolver library is available on the classpath.</p>
