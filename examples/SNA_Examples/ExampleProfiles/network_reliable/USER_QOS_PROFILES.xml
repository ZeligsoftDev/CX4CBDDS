XML QoS Profile 

The QoS configuration of the DDS entities in the generated example is 
loaded from this file.

This file is used only when it is in the current working directory
or when the enviroment variable
NDDS_QOS_PROFILES is defined and points to this file.

For more information about XML QoS Profiles see Chapter 15 in the 
RTI Data Distribution Service user manual.

<!-- You may want to change the profile name to something more suitable for
     your component assembly. Which profile is used is set in the deployment 
     plan as the connector's "qos_profile" setting: in this case, "qos_profile"
     would be set to "SNA_Example#NetworkedReliable_QOS". The string before
     the octothorp (#) represents the qos_library name, and the string after it
     represents the qos_profile name. -->
