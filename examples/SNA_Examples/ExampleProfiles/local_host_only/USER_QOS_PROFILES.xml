Description
XML QoS Profile 

The QoS configuration of the DDS entities in the generated example is 
loaded from this file.

This file is used only when it is in the current working directory
or when the enviroment variable
NDDS_QOS_PROFILES is defined and points to this file.

           	does not guarantee message transfer. However, for this example,
           	messages are being transported over shared memory, so we expect
           	dropped messages to be rare.
           history = Here, the writer only keeps one message in its queue, and
           	the reader keeps only four.
           durability = The default setting holds here: volatile durability. 
           	This means that late-joining components do not recieve messages
           	published before they joined. -->
