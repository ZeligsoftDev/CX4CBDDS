General Issues:
* P2 Issue 175 - Missing <artifact> references in CDP file component & DDS4CCM connector <implementation> entries

DDS4CCM Related Issues:

* P2 Issue 145 - Local SimplexReceptacle ports on CDP file DDS4CCM connectors incorrectly tagged as Facets
* P2 Issue 188 - DDS4CCM connector <location> tags wrong in CDP file <artifact> entries
