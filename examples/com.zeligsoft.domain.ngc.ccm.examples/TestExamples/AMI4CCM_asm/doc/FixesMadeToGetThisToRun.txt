AMI4CCM_asm Example - 02/13/2011

The included CX-generated IDL source tree built with no errors or changes required.
However, the CX-generated CDP file required a number of edits to fix the issues listed below in order to deploy:

General Issues:
* P2 Issue 175 - Missing <artifact> references in CDP file component & DDS4CCM connector <implementation> entries
* P4 Issue 142 - Newlines & comments in CDP XML file for readability (added to highlight changes made to CDP file)

* P2 Issue 190 - AMI4CCM connection in CDP file has wrong instance ID
