Shapes_asm Example - 02/13/2011

The original hand-crafted source for this example is in the DOC Group repository on the Internet at:

https://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/viewvc/Middleware/trunk/CIAO/connectors/dds4ccm/tutorials/Shapes/Shapes_asm/

That "Shapes" example was used in an interop demo with RTI, PT & Twin Oaks at the last OMG meeting.
It MUST use the DDS ShapeType message as defined, outside a module, to enabled cross-vendor interoperability.
This is a good example of adapting models to support both internal & external naming/definition conventions.

Below are the fixes made to this CX-generated source tree in order to get it to successfully
build and deploy, including the issue number assigned to each.

************* MODEL CHANGES ***************

The original hand-crafted source defines ushorts and ulongs as component attribute types on the Control_comp.
Due to issue 185, these had to be temporarily changed to all longs to make the example deployable error-free.
To debug this issue, suggest changing these attributes back in the model - CORBA Shorts, UShorts & ULongs don't work.

* P2 Issue 185 - Only CORBA longs and strings are supported for component attributes in CDP file

************* IDL GENERATION ERROR ****************

Due to issue 184, one of the IDL files generated from the included CX model was wrong, and had to be edited.
A single missing line, the typedef for the DDS message sequence, was added to the repaired file.

Original file is at:                                 ports\Shapes_ShapeType_conn.idl_orig
Edited file that built & deployed correctly is at:   ports\Shapes_ShapeType_conn.idl

* P2 Issue 184 - Connector IDL generation error when using messages not in a module (missing typedef for msg sequence)

************* CDP GENERATION ERRORS ***************

A number of edits were required to the generated CDP file to address the following issues:

General Issues:
* P2 Issue 175 - Missing <artifact> references in CDP file component & DDS4CCM connector <implementation> entries
* P4 Issue 142 - Newlines & comments in CDP XML file for readability (added to highlight changes made to CDP file)

DDS4CCM Related Issues:
* P2 Issue 145 - Local SimplexReceptacle ports on CDP file DDS4CCM connectors incorrectly tagged as Facets
* P2 Issue 188 - DDS4CCM connector <location> tags wrong in CDP file <artifact> entries

Directory Structure:
* P2 Issue 156 - CDD/CDP files generated to target wrong directory (Deployment folder moved in attached source)

Original file is at:                         Deployment\descriptors\Plan.cdp
Edited file that deployed correctly is at:   Deployment\descriptors\PlanFixed.cdp
