		<h1>CX SCA Workflow Overview</h1>
		<p>Use this workflow overview as a guide when planning your modeling process. Your model may contain other elements and properties, but 
			you can use this as a "loose" guide to help you understand the modeling workflow in CX.</p>
		<h3>Create a new project and model.</h3>
		<p>Open the Spectra CX perspective and create a new SCA model project. The name of the project and the model will appear in the Project 
			Explorer. The CDT Project Name determines the name of the folder source code will be generated to.</p>
		<p>This project can contain one or more SCA models. 
</p>
		<p>When planning your model development, you may want to consider using multiple diagrams to visualize model elements and
			the relationships.</p>
		<h3>Model Waveform</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a new package.</li>
			<p>You can use packages to group or contain common elements and to help you better organize your elements.</p>
			<p>In this workflow example, this package will represent a controller.</p>
			<li>Within this new package, create a Zeligsoft Component Diagram.</li>
			<p>Creating a diagram for each package allows you to manage the visual modeling more easily and to prevent diagrams from becoming 
			cluttered.</p>
			<li>In the Zeligsoft Component Diagram, create the following elements:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>component interface</li>
				<li>component structural realization</li>
				<li>implementation artifact: you can create as many implementations as required by your system. For example, you may want to create an 
implementation for each supported operating system.</li>
				<li>interface realization: shows the relationship between the component interface and the interface it implements (usually CF::Resource interface)</li>
				<li>generalization: shows the relationship between the component structure realization and the component interface </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note: The component wizard can be used for steps 1, 2, and 3.</p>
			<li>To manage the implementation dependencies such as the operating system, processors, etc. add:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>operating system </li>
				<li>operating system link: connect the implementation artifact and operating system</li>
				<li>processor </li>
				<li>processor link </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Create PortTypes and add ports on the component interface.</li>
			<li>Create other components.</li><br>Create a new package and Zeligsoft Component Diagram to represent your application. In the Zeligsoft Component Diagram: <ul>
				<li>create an application and resize it</li>
				<li>drag the component structural realization you created above from the Project Explorer onto the application structure - this creates 
			component parts</li>
				<li>using the connector tool, connect the ports</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Validate your application and components.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Elaborate Elements</h3>
		<p>Now that you have created your elements, you can define them by editing the properties, adding property types from the palette, and 
			adding user-defined attributes.</p>
		<p>Use enumeration property type, primitive property type, struct property type, and struct sequence property type to define element properties. 
			As well you can add property dependencies to further define elements and element relationships.</p>
		<h3>Model Platform</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a new package and diagram for the platform.</li>
			<li>Within this package, create a new package and diagram to represent a node.</li>
			<li>Within the platform package, use the Component Wizard to create the device.</li>
			<li>Define attributes for the device.</li>
			<li>Add the device to the node.</li>
			<p>In the Project Explorer, select the device structural realization and drag it onto the node in the Zeligsoft Component Diagram.</p>
			<li>Add a DeviceManager and DomainManager to the Node.</li>
			<li>Validate the Platform, Node, and Devices.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Generate Code</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Select the application and generate the component source code and the XML descriptors. Select the node and generate the device source 
			code and XML descriptors.</li>
			<li>Add user code to the worker methods.</li>
			<li>Compile the source code.</li>
		</ol>
