		<h1>User Interface Conventions</h1>
		<p>Spectra CX is built on the Eclipse Workbench and Rational Software Modeler environments. As a result the CX user interface simply re-uses the conventions
			and containers provided by Eclipse and Rational Software Modeler.</p>
		<p>For details about the user interface and how to manipulate it, please refer to the Eclipse and Rational Software Modeler help topics devoted to the user interface. There 
			are a number of tutorials that will help you become familiar with your work environment.</p>
		<p>CX specific capabilities including windows, wizards, and pop-up menus behave the same way as the Eclipse and Rational Software Modeler elements. Any CX specific 
			user interface elements are highlighted and noted in the appropriate online help topics.</p>
		<h3>Perspectives</h3>
		<p>A window contains one or more "perspectives". A perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in  the window. Each
			perspective provides different functionality to accomplish a specific task with specific resources.</p>
		<p>The CX perspective has views for modeling components and applications and generating code. The debug perspective has
 views of tools for target debug and the 
C/C++ perspective has information about building code.</p>
		<h3>Quick UI Reference</h3>
		<p>The following list provides you with a quick reference overview of the UI:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <a href="#pe">Project Explorer</a> view provides access to all model elements.</li>
			<li>Model elements are contained in a collapsible folder tree or "Packages".</li>
			<li>The <a href="#pal">Palette</a> provides new element types for selecting and dropping into a diagram.</li>
			<li>The <a href="#pv">Properties View</a> provides access to details of a selected element.</li>
			<li>The Console view provides status information such as the build progress.</li>
			<li>The Problem view displays problems such as problems with validation or compilation.</li>
			<li>The Outline View shows the entire view of the selected diagram.</li>
		</ul>
