		<h1>Packages</h1>
		<p>Packages are used to group model elements. A package can contain multiple different element type. You can use packages to 
			organize your model to enable easier visibility and understanding of model elements. Packages can also be used to model the
			system architecture, with packages representing different layers. Additionally, the use of packages can make it simpler and faster 
			for you to find elements in the Project Explorer. Packages can have an unlimited number of sub-packages.</p>
		<p>Packages can be created from two locations: from the Project Explorer and from the Palette.</p>
		<p>When you have created a package, you need to apply a profile and stereotype to the package:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select the package in either the Project Explorer or the Zeligsoft Component Diagram.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Properties View</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles</strong> tab.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Apply Profile</strong>, select <strong>Zeligsoft Base Profile</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
			<li>Select the <strong>Stereotypes</strong> tab, click <strong>Apply Stereotype</strong>, select a stereotype and 
			click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>To add elements to a package, you can click and drag the elements within the Project Explorer onto the package or do the same 
			within the Zeligsoft Component Diagram.</p>
		<p>To show package contents, use the triangle symbols in the package to show the content and to navigate the package. The 
			Project Explorer is updated to display package contents.</p>
