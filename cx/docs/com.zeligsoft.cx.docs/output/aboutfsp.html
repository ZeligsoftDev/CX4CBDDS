		<h1>Freestanding FindBy Ports</h1>
		<p>A Free Standing Port (FSP) models a port or a service that is dynamically discovered during runtime. The SCA uses dynamic port discovery in some of its connection 
		specifications (findby, deviceusedbythiscomponentref, devicethatloadedthiscomponentref). The information on the port is used by the SCA Core 
		Framework to locate an instance (component, device, core framework or service) or a port on an instance that adheres to the information on 
		the FSP. This port is then used in the connection.</p>
		<p>FSPs can be used in CX to model these connection specifications elegantly. Actual discovery of the ports is the responsibility of the 
		SCA Core Framework. CX allows you to model all connections that are available according to the SCA standard. An FSP can model a uses or provides 
		port or a supports interface.</p>
		<p>In this drawer the following freestanding port (FSP) element options are available:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>FSP DomainFinder-NamingService</li>
			<li>FSP DomainFinder-Log</li>
			<li>FSP DomainFinder-FileManager</li>
			<li>FSP DomainFinder-EventChannel</li>
			<li>FSP DomainFinder-ServiceName (waveforms only)</li>
			<li>FSP DomainFinder-ServiceType (waveforms only)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These FSPs can be described as: CX supports all connection types as 
		given in the SCA, including the specification of connections via FindBy_DomainFinder as per section D.6.5.1.1.3.2 of the SCA domain profile. The 
		domainfinder element is used to indicate to the CF ApplicationFactory the necessary information to find an object reference that is of 
		specific type and may also be known by an optional name within the domain. The valid type attributes 
		are filemanager, log, eventchannel, namingservice, servicename and servicetype. If a name attribute is not supplied, then the component reference 
		returned is the CF DomainManager's FileManager or Naming Service corresponding to the type attribute provided. If a name attribute is not 
		supplied and the type attribute has a value of log, then a null reference is returned. The type attribute value of eventchannel is used to 
		specify the event channel to be used in the OE's CORBA Event Service for producing or consuming events. If the name attribute is not 
		supplied and the type attribute has a value of eventchannel then the Incoming Domain Management event channel is used.</p>
		<p>To create an FSP do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <strong>Palette</strong>, select the <strong>FSP</strong> that you want to create.</li>
			<li>Drop the <strong>FSP</strong> onto the appropriate element in the <strong>Zeligsoft Component Diagram</strong>.</li>
			<li>From the pop-up menu, select <strong>Select Existing Element</strong> and Search or Browse for the
		<strong>Port Type</strong> you want to use.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Note: When modeling FSP DomainFinder-ServiceName or FSP DomainFinder-ServiceType the SCA 2.2.2 Extension preference must be set in <strong>Windows</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Zeligsoft</strong> &gt; <strong>SCA</strong>.</p>
