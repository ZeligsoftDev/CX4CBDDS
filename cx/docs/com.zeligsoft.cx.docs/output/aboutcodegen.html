		<h1>Code Generation</h1>
		<p>This section describes the completely customizable, out-of-the-box Spectra CX Code Generator and build environment and how SCA code 
			generation 
works within CX.</p>
		<h2>Component Makeup</h2>
		<p>The complete code base for an SCA-compliant component comprises two major parts: 
the SCA component code and the functional code.  The component 
code manages all the SCA artifacts, ports, and properties through the <code>CF::Resource</code> interface.  The functional code 
contains the signal processing and control behaviour for a component.</p>
		<h2>Device Makeup</h2>
		<p>The complete code base for an SCA-compliant component comprises two major parts: 
the SCA component code and the functional code.  The component 
code manages all the SCA artifacts, ports, and properties through the device interfaces: <code>CF::Device, CF::LoadableDevice, 
CF::ExecutableDevice, and CF::AggregateDevice</code>.  The functional code 
contains the signal processing and control behaviour for a device.</p>
		<h2>CORBA Versus Non-CORBA</h2>
		<p>As shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, the SCA component and device code is the outer shell of a component or device.  It manages any CORBA 
calls that come in.  
It performs as much processing as necessary and passes call to the functional code when needed.</p>
		<p>The functional code is non-CORBA code.</p>

		<p>Code generation, as described in this document, means generation of the SCA component and device code, as well as the makefiles required to 
build this code. The functional code can be implemented in a separate workflow within Rational Software Modeler. The component and device code forwards calls to the functional code for handling where needed.</p>
