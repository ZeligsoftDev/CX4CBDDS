		<h1>About CX</h1>
		<p>CX is the latest product offering in Zeligsoft's Component-Oriented Engineering (COE) methodology-driven suite. CX is built on the 
			Eclipse and Rational Software Modeler development environments. CX has been designed to integrate fully with these development
			environments - taking advantage of key Rational Software Modeler and Eclipse concepts and capabilities. CX is an extension of this functionality, giving you 
			the benefit of a system-centric software development tool essential for the design of re-usable software components that take advantage of 
			advanced multiprocessor, multicore and 
			System on Chip (SoC) architectures. CX provides the design, development and maintenance support for system structure, and inter-component 
			communication and control, allowing 
			developers to manage software complexity and rapidly adapt software to new platforms. CX's powerful visual system representation is 
			UML 2.0 compliant to give 
			cross-functional and geographically-dispersed team members critical insight into system structure.</p>
		<p>CX is a domain specific modeling environment, as such domain specific information can be installed. Contact Zeligsoft 
			to find out more about domain support. Domains can be specialized within CX to facilitate your use patterns and domain 
			requirements.</p>
