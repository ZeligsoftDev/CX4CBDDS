		<h1>Connectors</h1>
		<p>A connection determines how components communicate act with one another. It specifies the relationship between the provider of an interface and the user of an interface. 
		</p>
		<p>A connector is a communication link between two ports or a port and a supports interface. The ports are compatible if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Both ports realize the same interface or the provides port interface is a subclass of the uses port interface.</li>
			<li>One port's conjugation is the inverse of the other.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To define a connection in CX, do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <strong>Palette</strong>, click <strong>Connector</strong>.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Zeligsoft Component Diagram</strong>, select the first element in the relationship. If this is not a valid 
		selection, a circle with a strike-through is displayed.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Zeligsoft Component Diagram</strong>, click and drag the connector to the second element in the relationship.</li>
			<p>Edit the name of the connector. You can also edit the connector properties in the Properties View.</p>
		</ol>
		<p>To ensure that descriptor generation works for connections to supported interfaces, make sure you are connecting
		directly to the component. </p>
