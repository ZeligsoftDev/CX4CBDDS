		<h1>Validation</h1>
		<p>CX has a robust and powerful validation engine. The validation the elements you add to your model are correct.</p>
		<p>CX validation uses a containment hierarchy. That is, if you validate a package in CX, everything contained in the package is also validated.</p>
		<p>CX assists you in ensuring that the generated XML complies with the SCA. The validation that CX performs saves you time since correct 
generation means that all pieces of the puzzle fit. Hence situations where incorrect XML is downloaded to an execution environment are avoided.</p>
		<p>Using the Preferences window, you can disable the built-in validation rules.</p>
