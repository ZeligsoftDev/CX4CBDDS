		<h1>SCA Port Libraries</h1>
		<p>Shared libraries are used when the build configuration specifies options for shared libraries. So instead of creating static libraries for each Port, framework, etc, a shared library is created and the executable is linked with these. This means that the shared libraries have to be on the library path for the given target platform.</p>
		<p>
			SCAPortLibraries can be modeled in CX and then referenced as a software package reference dependency. This specifies a Software Package Dependency (SPD) to the shared library. 
			</p>
		<p>
			For example, create a SCAPortLibrary component named SCAPortLibrary with an implementation for Linux:
			</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li> Create a package named SharedLibraries.</li>
				<li>Right click on the SharedLibraries package and select Add Diagram &gt; Zeligsoft  
				   Component Diagram Name the diagram SharedLibaries_Diag. </li>
				<li> In the Application Palette, select Port Library and drop this element onto 
				   SharedLibaries _Diag.</li>
				<li> Name the element SCAPortLibrary. </li>
				<li> In the Properties View &gt; SCA tab, deselect SCA Compliant.</li>
				<li> Add an Implementation Artifact to the SharedLibaries_Diag and name it 
				   SCAPortLibrary_linux. Draw a Component Implementation link from the 
				   implementation to the SCAPortLibrary. </li>
				<li> Select the implementation. In the Properties View &gt; SCA tab open the Code and 
				   name the file libScaPortLibrary.so. Note that the Port Library file name must have 
				   the appropriate extension.</li>
				<li> Right click on the implementation and select a build configuration for shared 
				   libraries (i.e. linux_x86_gcc_zcf100_sca22_omni410_build_sharedlibs)</li>
				<li> Add any necessary dependencies to the SharedLibaries_Diag and draw the 
				   appropriate dependency links from the SCAPortLibrary_linux implementation to the dependencies.</li>
				<li> SCA validate. </li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			To use the shared library draw Resource Dependency from one or more component or device implementations to the SCAPortLibrary. The SCAPortLibrary requires an implementation that uses the same build configuration as the source of the Resource Dependency. 
			</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li> Open a component or device diagram and drag the SCAPortLibrary onto the 
				  diagram. </li>
				<li> Draw a Resource Dependency from the component or device implementation to the 
				  SCAPortLibrary. </li>
				<li> Generate Source. </li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The SCAPortLibrary will contain the ports and interfaces needed by all devices and components that reference the SCAPortLibrary and have an implementation that matches the SCAPortLibrary implementation.
