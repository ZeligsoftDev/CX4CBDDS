		<h1>Modeling</h1>
		<p>Use the topics in this section to learn how to use CX and how to take advantage of the inherited Rational Software Modeler and Eclipse functionality.</p>
		<p>This section provides detailed "how to" information that will guide you through the process of creating, editing, and managing 
			your model and its elements. Content is organized in a systematic order to help guide you through the workflow process.</p>
		<p>Model elements comprise the model. They include packages, components, devices, CF  elements, applications, nodes, deployments, ports 
			and interfaces and the connections between them. Model elements can have SCA and user-defined attributes. Relationships can be 
			defined between model elements. Most model elements have graphical representations.</p>
		<h3>Modeling Best Practices</h3>
		<p>When defining your model it is key to remember that the source and target have important implications - think about who depends on what:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Does my definition need a property from another definition?</li>
			<li>Does my definition need a property from an implementation?</li>
			<li>Does my implementation need a property from a definition?</li>
			<li>Does my implementation need a property of an implementation?</li>
		</ol>
