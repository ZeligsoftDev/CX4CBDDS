		<h1>IDL Modeling, Import, and Generation</h1>
		<p>CX can be used to model new IDL or import existing IDL and generate IDL.</p>
		<p>An IDL interface is a set of operations and attributes used for CORBA communication. Ports on components are a realization of these 
interfaces and are used to allow the component to communicate with its environment and the environment to communicate with the component.
</p>
		<p>The component does not know who is using its interface nor does the environment know about the internals of the component. All communication 
			must go through the component's ports. This facilitates reuse of interface-based components in multiple applications.</p>
		<h2>Modeling IDL</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <strong>Palette</strong>, open the <strong>CORBA</strong> drawer and select <strong>IDL File</strong>.</li>
			<li>Drop the <strong>IDL File</strong> onto your diagram and draw the element quite large.</li>
			<li>In the element, click the small arrow/triangle so that it is open or pointing down.</li>
			<p>This enables you to add elements to the <strong>IDL File</strong> element.</p>
			<li>In the <strong>Palette</strong>, select <strong>Module</strong>.</li>
			<li>Drop the <strong>Module</strong> onto the <strong>IDL File</strong> in the compartment you opened.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Module</strong>, click the small arrow/triangle so that it is open or pointing down.</li>
			<p>This enables you to add elements to the <strong>Module</strong> element.</p>
			<li>In the <strong>Palette</strong>, select <strong>Interface</strong>.</li>
			<li>Drop the <strong>Interface</strong> onto the <strong>Module</strong> in the compartment you opened.</li>
			<li>Using the <strong>Properties View</strong> &gt; <strong>Attributes</strong> tab you can add and 
			define CORBA attributes on this interface.</li>
			<p>To show the attributes in the diagram, select the <strong>Appearance</strong> tab and enable 
			<strong>Show Attributes</strong>.</p>
			<p>If you added attributes to the interface, you need to ensure the correct stereotype is applied. In the 
			<strong>Properties View</strong> &gt; <strong>Stereotypes</strong> tab, click <strong>Apply Stereotype</strong> 
			and select <strong>CORBAAttribute</strong>.</p>
			<p>Using the <strong>Properties View</strong> &gt; <strong>Operations</strong> tab, you can add operations to the 
			interface. Ensure you apply the <strong>CORBAOperation</strong> stereotype to the operation.</p>
			<li>To add a CORBA Exception to the module, in the <strong>Palette</strong>, select <strong>Exception</strong> and 
			drop the element into the compartment on the module. To show the exception, use the <strong>Appearance</strong> 
			tab in the <strong>Properties View</strong>.</li>
			<li>A CORBA Constant can be added at the interface or module level. To add a CORBA Constant at the 
			interface level, add an attribute and set the <strong>Stereotypes</strong> to <strong>CORBAConstant</strong>. 
			To add a CORBA Constant at the module level, in the <strong>Palette</strong>, select <strong>Constant</strong> and 
			drop this onto the module.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Using the <strong>UML Properties</strong> option on the right-click pop-up menu you can do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>control the order of elements in the generated IDL file: select <strong>Package Element</strong> and use the 
			arrows to control the element order.</li>
			<li>define an exception on an operation on an interface: select <strong>RaisedException</strong> and then select 
			the exception.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>IDL Import</h2>
		<p>CX IDL import will merge external IDL changes into existing IDL elements in the CX model. All model references to the 
			IDL elements are maintained in the model. Because of this CX supports iterative workflows where IDL is changed outside the 
			CX and re-imported. </p>
		<p>To import the IDL into your model do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Copy and paste the IDL file into your project folder in <strong>Project Explorer</strong>.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> select the <strong>Model</strong> and using the <strong>CTRL key</strong>, select 
				the <strong>IDL files or folder</strong>. </li>
			<li>With both elements selected, right-click and from the context menu select <strong>Import</strong>. Select  
<strong>Spectra CX</strong> and select <strong>IDL</strong>. The Import window will open. </li>
			<li>Browse to the Source folder and select the IDL to import. </li>
			<li>Browse to the SCA model where the IDL is to be imported to. </li>
			<li>Add any <strong>include directories</strong> and <strong>defines</strong> that are necessary for the IDL. </li>
			<li><strong>Files to exclude</strong>. This is used to exclude IDL files from IDL import. This could be IDL files that are 
				referenced by the IDL to be imported. An example where this is useful is when importing IDL that references the SCA CF.idl. 
				This IDL is already present in the SCA model in a read only library. Since this element is read only, if this file is not 
				excluded from the import, a new CF element will be created in the model. If the file is excluded, the existing CF element 
				will be referenced in the model</li>
			<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>After import, the IDL Model Elements should appear in the model in an IDL_Import_Results package. Once all files have been imported, 
			the IDL directory can be deleted from the Spectra CX Project.</p>
		<h2>Generating IDL</h2>
		<p>To generate your IDL file, select and right-click the <strong>IDL File</strong> and from the context menu, select 
			<strong>CX Generate</strong> &gt; <strong> Generate IDL</strong>. </p>
		<p>The generated IDL file is added to the Project Explorer in a folder that is named based on the CDT Project Name you defined 
when you created your model. To view your IDL file, select and double-click the file. This opens the CX editor.</p>
