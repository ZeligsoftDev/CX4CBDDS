		<h1>Properties</h1>
		<p>This section provides details about configuring element properties in CX. </p>
		<p>Each element is completely customizable to meet the needs of your modeling environment. To define elements, use the 
		Properties View.</p>
		<p>When an element is created or selected, the Properties View is opened. The Properties View includes a number of sections that you use to define, edit and view element properties.
		 These sections are described below.</p>
		<p>Note: Some of the properties are specific to Rational Software Modeler, for information on these properties, refer to the Rational Software Modeler online documentation.</p>
