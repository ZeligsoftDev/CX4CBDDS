		<h1>Deployment Editor</h1>
		<p>To create a deployment, do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, right-click your <strong>model</strong> and from the pop-up menu, select 
<strong>Add Zeligsoft</strong> &gt; <strong>Deployment</strong>.</li><br>The deployment is added to the Project Explorer with the following format: <i>Deploymentnumber</i>. Edit the default name to suit your model.</ul>
		<p>To open and view a deployment, in the Deployment Editor, do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, right-click a <strong>deployment</strong> and from the pop-up menu, select 
<strong>Open with Deployment Editor</strong>.</li><br>-OR-<li>In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, double-click a <strong>deployment</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Deployment Editor has two panes: Configure and Deploy.</p>
		<p><img src="../images/deploymentpanes.gif" alt="Deployment Editor"></p>
		<p>The Configure pane is used to create deployment parts for a deployment. Deployable source and target elements need to be configured 
using the Configure pane.</p>
		<p><img src="../images/configurepane2.gif" alt="Configure Pane"></p>
		<p>Right-click an element to display the following options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Expand All: this expands the element to show member elements.</li>
			<li>Show In Project Explorer: this highlights the element in the Project Explorer.</li>
			<li>Delete: this deletes the element from the Deployment Tree Editor.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To create deployment parts, do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> select a valid model element and drag it onto the <strong>Configure</strong> pane.</li><br>The element is added to the Configure pane and displayed in the tree and a deployment part is created on the deployment.<br>If you try to drag an invalid element onto the Configure pane, it will be disallowed.</ul>
		<p>The Deploy pane is used to define allocations (deployed elements).</p>
		<p><img src="../images/deploypane.gif" alt="Deploy Pane"></p>
		<p>To deploy an element, do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <strong>Configure</strong> pane, select the deployment target element.</li>
			<li>Drag and drop the selected element onto the <strong>Deploy</strong> pane.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Configure</strong> pane, select the deployable source element.</li>
			<li>Drag and drop the selected element onto the target element item in the Deploy pane.</li><br>An allocation is added to the deployment model element and it is displayed in the Deploy pane. Allocations are 
displayed in <strong>bold</strong>.<br>The Deployment Editor disallows invalid deployments. If you drag an element and hover over an unexpanded element, the tree node 
will automatically expand.</ol>
		<p>Right-click an element to display the following options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Expand All: this expands the element to show member elements.</li>
			<li>Show In Project Explorer: this highlights the element in the Project Explorer.</li>
			<li>Undeploy: Undeploys the element.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The deployment model element is contained within a model or package. If that model or package has been edited and is 
therefore marked as dirty, the Deployment Editor is also marked as dirty. A save in the Deployment Editor is the
 equivalent to a save of the container model or package.</p>
		<p>If any of the model elements relevant to the deployment are edited, the deployment is updated to reflect the changes.</p>
		<h2>Filtering Deployment Parts</h2>
		<p>If the Deployment Elements filter is toggled on, the deployment parts of a deployment do not show in the Project Explorer.</p>
		<p>To control the display of deployment parts do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, select the <strong>Deployment</strong>.</li>
			<li>On the tab in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, select the <strong>View Menu</strong> arrow.</li>
			<li>Select <strong>Customize View</strong>.</li>
			<li>Enable or disable <strong>Deployment Elements</strong> on the <strong>Filters</strong> tab.</li>
		</ol>
