		<h1>Platforms</h1>
		<p>A platform is a set of nodes under the control of a single domain manager. A platform can contain one or more nodes, one of these nodes
		 needs to contain a domain manager. The content of the platform is generated into 
the complete device profile</p>
		<p>A platform is a modeling entity introduced by CX. The SCA equivalent of the platform is the entire set of DCDs that comprise 
the Domain.</p>
		<p>Typical platform layers include a hardware layer composed of different types of processors (GPP, DSP, FPGA), memory buses, and inter 
			connections, and the RTOS layer and middleware layers that provide services to application components. Similarly to applications, platform 
			layers can be individually defined in a component-based manner.</p>
		<p>You must define the domain manager for each platform. Using the Palette or Component Wizard, create a domain manager and then in Project 
			Explorer, drag the 
			domain manager on to the platform. Optionally, you can configure a file manager and SCAlog for the platform.</p>
