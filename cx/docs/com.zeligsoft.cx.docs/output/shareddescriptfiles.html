		<h1>Shared Descriptor Files</h1>
		<p>Property-files (PRF) files can be shared by multiple model elements a practice frequently used because it saves time when creating XML files.</p>
		<p>CX allows import of these shared XML files, which results in multiple model elements referring to the same XML files for generation. This 
			results in correct XML if and only if the content of those files (and hence the content of the model elements) is the same. Different 
			content for these model elements may lead to unexpected behavior. CX indicates shared XML files with an error to prevent possible problems.</p>
		<p>As an example, say that after import, component A and B both share a property file. If A and B have the same properties, then this is fine. 
			However, if you add a property to A, then the components generate a different property file. The final content of the XML property file 
			depends on which component was generated last, which is undefined. CX indicates these XML files with an error.</p>
