		<h1>Interfaces</h1>
		<p>Client-server relationships are set up by making connections between component ports. In an SCA-compliant implementation, these connections 
		are made using CORBA interfaces.</p>
		<p>An interface is the subject of an IDL definition. It may have attributes and/or operations. Operations may have parameters and return 
values. An interface may be specified in the SCA or be component-specific. SCA-specific interfaces are classified conceptually as either
 base application, control or service interfaces. The interfaces are used in the definition of supports interfaces and uses and provides ports. </p>
		<p>To add attributes and/or operations to an interface, use the Properties View, select the Attributes or Operations tab, right-click and select Add.
