		<h1>Nodes</h1>
		<p>A node consists of one device manager and a set of one or more hardware devices. A node contains one or more logical 
		abstractions of physical hardware elements. A node can contain one or more devices and their connections. One of these devices needs to be 
		an executable device. The content of the node defines the information in the DCD.</p>
		<p>In UML modeling, nodes are model elements that represent the computational resources of a system, such as personal computers,
         sensors, printing devices, and servers. Nodes can be interconnected by using communication paths to describe network structures.</p>
		<p>A node can be visualized as the logical abstraction of a hardware board that can be added or removed from the system.</p>
		<p>You must define the device manager for each node. Using the Palette, create a device manager and then in Project Explorer, drag the 
			device manager on to the node. Optionally, you can configure a file manager and SCAlog for the node.</p>
		<p>Once you have created a node, use the Properties View to define the <strong>namingservice</strong> property for the node. Set this 
			property to the <strong>Domain Manager</strong> you created.</p>
