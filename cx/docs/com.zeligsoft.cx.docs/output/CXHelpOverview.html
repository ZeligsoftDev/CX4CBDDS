		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Copyright 2010  Inc.</p>
		<p>Spectra CX<sup>TM</sup> is a component-oriented engineering (COE) development tool essential for the design of re-usable software 
			components that take advantage of advanced multiprocessor, multicore and 
			System on Chip (SoC) architectures. CX provides the design, development and maintenance support for system structure, and inter-component 
			communication and control, allowing 
			developers to minimize software complexity and rapidly adapt software to new platforms. CX's powerful visual system representation uses a 
			UML 2.0 interface to give 
			cross-functional and geographically-dispersed team members critical insight into system structure.</p>
		<p>CX is built on top of the IBM Rational Software Modeler (RSM) and utilizes many of its capabilities and functionality.</p>
		<p>CX enables developers to model, configure, integrate, and validate 
			 applications through a 			<!--&lt;span class="sca"&gt;Software Communication Architecture (SCA)-compliant radio platforms and waveform&lt;/span&gt;-->

			UML 2.0 interface. CX then automatically verifies your model and generates the complete set of artifacts for your domain, reducing development time from 
			months to just days. 			<!--&lt;span class="sca"&gt;Moreover, CX has runtime  monitoring of applications 
				running on a Core Framework.&lt;/span&gt;-->
