		<h1>Application and Platform Modeling</h1>
		<h2>Components</h2>
		<p>Components encompass discrete responsibilities within the system, each with a behavioral and structural aspect. CX allows you to completely 
			describe the external interface of components using abstractions, including method calls and data transportation</p>
		<h2>Applications</h2>
		<p>CX permits the expression of a clear separation between application and platform model elements with comprehensive application and  
			logical platform modeling capabilities. UML 2 based modeling techniques are used to organize and visually represent the system structure. 
			The system level complexity (for a single or multiple applications) is managed through organizing software through decomposition and multiple 
			views.</p>
		<p>Application and platform dependencies are clearly expressed in the CX modeling environment. The functional aspects of a component are defined separately from its control and 
			communications aspects, which results in easy-to-manage, re-usable software components that are interconnected and assembled into applications. These applications are easily 
			ported to other platforms, and combined with other software applications.</p>
		<p>Visual representation ensures that component dependencies are explicit and easy to manage. Dependencies such as a 
component requiring another component, a service or specific hardware are depicted through visible and programmable elements accessible by all team members, regardless of location.</p>
		<p>CX allows you to represent multiple layers of the architecture, regardless of the complexity of each layer or dependencies present from layer to layer. As such, CX 
			scales from very simple applications and platforms to the most complex of systems, with powerful component design techniques supporting the reuse of design elements at 
			whatever layer you want.</p>
		<p>The model can be verified, at any level, for correctness against standard modeling rules.</p>
		<h2>Logical Platform</h2>
		<p>A platform model describes a set of technical concepts representing its constituent elements and the services it provides. It also 
			specifies constraints on the use of these elements and services by other parts of the system. Platform Modeling lets you model logical 
			platforms. CX lets users fully specify the platforms that their applications will be deployed to.</p>
		<p>CX enables designers to specify complete component-based software architectures that represent the system from multiple perspectives,
 multiple view-points, and multiple levels.</p>
		<p>Modeling a logical platform allows you to specify the system's logical aspects, covering the execution environment, services, and 
			higher-level communication mechanisms available on the platform. </p>
		<p>At the logical platform level, services whether security, logging, inter-process, or intra-process communications required by application 
components are provided through ports with interfaces that capture the service access methods. The service could represent a timer, a driver, or 
similar concept.</p>
		<p>By first modeling the services, CX can then generate optimized service access and communication code for the target system, freeing you from 
having to write this code and enabling you to focus on the behavioral aspects of the component. CX provides out-of-the-box model element 
definitions for the most common services and embedded system execution environments, such as RTOSs, communications middleware, and encryption and 
security layers.</p>
		<p>CX supports design flows beginning with any part of the system. You can begin defining at any level, moving up to application or down to the 
logical layer.</p>
