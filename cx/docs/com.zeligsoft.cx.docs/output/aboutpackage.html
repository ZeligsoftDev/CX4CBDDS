		<h1>Packages</h1>
		<p>Packages are used to group model elements. A package can contain multiple different element types. You can use packages to 
			organize your model to enable easier visibility and understanding of model elements. Packages can also be used to model the
			system architecture, with packages representing different layers. Additionally, the use of packages can make it simpler and faster 
			for you to find elements in the Project Explorer. Packages can have an unlimited number of sub-packages.</p>
		<p>Packages are a good way of organizing your model for validation purposes as well. Validating a package also validates everything 
			contained within the package.</p>
