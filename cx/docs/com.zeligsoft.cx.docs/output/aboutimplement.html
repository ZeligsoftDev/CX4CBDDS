		<h1>Implementing</h1>
		<p>Once your model has been created and validated, the next essential step is implementation. CX enables this to operate smoothly with
	its powerful code and descriptor generation functionality. </p>
		<p>The code and descriptor generation capabilities of CX leverage the complete configuration in the model to determine the optimal code 
	to generate for the applications and the communication between the connected elements. All of the information in the model is analyzed to 
	determine the most optimized way to generate the code.</p>
		<p>The use of COE methodology and code generation tools offers a decrease in development time and increase in the ability to re-use work and the 
	associated code.</p>
