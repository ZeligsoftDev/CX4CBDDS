		<h1>Applications</h1>
		<p>An executable software program may contain one or more modules. The executable software exhibits pre-determined functionality.
			In COE an application is created by assembling a set of components and providing connections between compatible ports 
			(formal interfaces) on adjacent components. Using Model Driven Design (MDD) techniques, individual components and the overall 
			application model can be validated for correctness at any point in the development process.</p>
		<p>An application is a set of components in a communicating architecture. An SCA application can have an unlimited number of component instances.</p>
		<p>To create an SCA Application, do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <strong>Palette</strong> select <strong>Application</strong> from the <strong>SCA Application</strong> drawer
			 and drop it onto a Zeligsoft Component Diagram.</li>
			<li>Select the Structure compartment on the Application and resize. </li>
			<li>Component structure realizations can be dragged from the Project Explorer to the Application structure to create component instances (parts).</li>
		</ol>
