# Parameters describing how and where to execute the build.
# Typical users need only update the following properties:
#    baseLocation - where things you are building against are installed
#    bootclasspath - The base jars to compile against (typicaly rt.jar)
#    configs - the list of {os, ws, arch} configurations to build.  
#
# Of course any of the settings here can be overridden by spec'ing 
# them on the command line (e.g., -DbaseLocation=d:/eclipse
