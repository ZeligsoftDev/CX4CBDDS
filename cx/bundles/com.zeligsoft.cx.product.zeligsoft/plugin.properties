productIntroOverview=CX is built on the  Eclipse and Rational Software Modeler (RSM)\
development environments. CX has been designed to integrate fully with these \
development environments - taking advantage of key RSM and Eclipse concepts and \
capabilities. CX is an extension of this functionality, giving you  the benefit \
of a system-centric software development tool essential for the design of re-usable \
software components that take advantage of  advanced multiprocessor, multicore and \
System on Chip (SoC) architectures. CX provides the design, development and \
maintenance support for system structure, and inter-component  communication and \
control, allowing developers to manage software complexity and rapidly adapt software \
to new platforms. CX's powerful visual system representation is  UML 2.0 compliant to \
give  cross-functional and geographically-dispersed team members critical insight \
into system structure.\n\
<br/><br/>\
CX is a domain specific modeling environment, as such domain specific information \
can be installed. Contact Zeligsoft  to find out more about domain support. \
Domains can be specialized within CX to facilitate your use patterns and domain \
requirements.
