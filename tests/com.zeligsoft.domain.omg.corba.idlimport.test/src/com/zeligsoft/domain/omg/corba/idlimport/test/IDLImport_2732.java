/**
 * Unresolved forward declaration
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * 
 * 1. Import of test21.idl fails because there is a forward declaration of an
 * interface that is not defined later in the file. 2. Import of test23.idl
 * fails because there is a forward declaration of an interface that is not
 * defined later in the file. 3. Import of test24.idl fails because there is a
 * forward declaration of an interface that is not defined in the current scope
 * later in the file. 4. Navigation for all three files is to the line
 * containing the unsatisfied forward declaration.
