/**
 * 
 * Import an IDL file containing three trivial interfaces.
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * 
 * 1. Import proceeds without errors or warnings. 2. Three interfaces are
 * brought into the tool. 3. The repository IDs of the interfaces reflect their
 * origin in the global scope or module as appropriate. 4. The interface
 * properties display "false" for Abstract and Local. 5. For the two interfaces
 * in the module, the inheritance structure below is preserved in the tool
 * (verify in properties):
 * 
 * module junkmodule { interface intfB { };
 * 
 * interface intfA: intfB { }; };
