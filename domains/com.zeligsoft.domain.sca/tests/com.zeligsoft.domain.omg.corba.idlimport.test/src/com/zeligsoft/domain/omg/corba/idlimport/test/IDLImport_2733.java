/**
 * Resolved forward declaration
 * 
 * Action: 1. Import artifact: test22.idl. It contains a forward declaration of
 * an interface that is defined later in the global scope, and a forward
 * declaration of an interface that is defined later in the module of the
 * declaration. In order to test namespacing, the same names have been used for
 * interfaces, relying on correct scope lookup to make everything work.
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * 
 * 1. Import succeeds and all four interfaces are brought into the tool. 2. Each
 * of the deriving interfaces correctly identifies the interface it inherits
 * from; the global interface from the other global interface, the module
 * interface from the other module interface. 3. Open the file in the import UI.
 * Note that the forward declaration was allowed to be entered numerous times.
