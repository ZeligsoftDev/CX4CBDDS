<h1>About CX for CBDDS</h1>
<p>CBDDS is a domain 
 specialization for Zeligsoft CX based on the DDS4CCM standard. DDS4CCM, 
 or DDS for Lightweight CCM, is a new OMG standard that integrates the 
 DDS and CCM real-time middleware standards. DDS4CCM improves on DDS by 
 providing a simpler API for the application developer, as well as deployment 
 and configuration support via CCM containers.</p>
<h2>CX Domain Specialization</h2>
<p>The concept of a component that we introduced is an example of a domain-specific 
 concept. It embodies a well-encapsulated, structural entity that a developer 
 can use to describe part of the behavior of the system in a re-usable 
 container. The entity can then be generated into compiled and executable 
 source code.</p>
<p>The component concept is but one of many cases where it can be beneficial 
 for the software development team to customize the language they use to 
 conceive, design and build systems—their 
 domain. The ability to customize the software tools for a domain is known 
 as Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) using Domain Specific Languages (DSL) 
 or domain specialization. Some other examples of concepts that can be 
 embodied in Domain Specific Languages include the events and alarms in 
 network infrastructure systems, traffic events in an infotainment device, 
 and configuration of specific paper types in a high-speed printer.</p>
<p>A DSL is created by the domain experts: it captures the knowledge that 
 the software development team has about the domain that they are building 
 products for. Translation from the domain concepts to implementation concepts 
 is also built by these domain experts. The result is really a development 
 environment with a raised abstraction level: it re-uses the domain knowledge 
 of the development team to increase productivity.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of Domain Specialization with CBD is that it can 
 generate code that is perfectly adapted to the environment of a particular 
 system. In many projects the software development team has a lot of knowledge 
 as to how to build software for their domain. CBD can be customized through 
 domain-specific modeling to visualize and automate that knowledge to offload 
 the development team and allow them to make the next jump in software 
 development productivity.</p>
<h2>The CBDDS Domain</h2>
<p>The CBDDS domain 
 specialization provides designers with an Eclipse perspective that is 
 well-suited to the architecting, design, development, and deployment of 
 DDS4CCM software. CBDDS 
 provides a model-based software engineering tool suite that combines component-based 
 architecture and design using CCM concepts with connector-based DDS messaging.</p>
<p>Architects can use CBDDS 
 to design the system software and define the software components. Working 
 with modeling elements such as (CCM) Parts, Interface and Event Ports, 
 and Connections they can</p>
<ul type="circle">
	<li class="p"><p>Functionally decompose their software system into 
	 its subsystems (assemblies) and components</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Characterize the I/O (ports) for each component</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Define the type of each port (client/service, publish/subscribe)</p></li>
	<li class="p"><p>Refine the component definitions by adding properties 
	 and attributes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Component Designers can use CBDDS 
 to model (define) the IDL for each port and message type. CBDDS’s correct-by-construction 
 IDL generation is used to generate a component specification for each 
 software component in the system.</p>
<p>After the components have been implemented, Deployment Planners and 
 Domain Experts can then use CBDDS 
 to model the target environments, plan deployments, and generate the deployment 
 and configuration plans.</p>
