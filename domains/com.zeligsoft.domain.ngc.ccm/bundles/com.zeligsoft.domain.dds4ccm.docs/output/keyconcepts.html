<h1>Reference</h1>
<p>Use this topic to learn more about CX, CBD, DDS4CCM, and UML modeling. 
 This topic provides detailed information about the key concepts you need 
 to understand and become familiar with.</p>
<h2><a name="Application" id="Application"></a>Application</h2>
<p>An executable software program that may contain one or more modules. 
 The executable software exhibits pre-determined functionality. In CBD 
 an application is created by assembling a set of components and providing 
 connections between compatible ports (formal interfaces) on adjacent components. 
 Using Model Driven Design (MDD) techniques, individual components and 
 the overall application model can be validated for correctness at any 
 point in the development process.</p>
<h2>Application Layer</h2>
<p>This layer describes the true software customization of the logical 
 platform. This is where the user puts the added value.</p>
<h2><a name="Assembly" id="Assembly"></a>Assembly</h2>
<p>An assembly is a structure of communicating <a href="#Component">components</a>. 
 Parts of an assembly are defined by <a href="#Component Interface">component 
 interfaces</a>. <a href="#Connection">Connections</a> in the assembly 
 indicate communication between component ports.</p>
<h2>Assembly Implementation</h2>
<p>See <a href="#Assembly">Assembly</a>. For components that are implemented 
 by assemblies of components (they can be decomposed into sub-components). 
 When you create a component (Add CX &gt; CCM Component) you may specify 
 the component has an assembly implementation or you can add an assembly 
 implementation at a later time.</p>
<h2><a name="Attributes" id="Attributes"></a>Attributes</h2>
<p>A property of a component specified by IDL. A significant piece of data 
 owned by a class, often containing values describing each instance of 
 the class. Besides the attribute name and a slot for the attribute value, 
 an attribute may have specified visibility, type, multiplicity, default 
 value, and property-string.</p>
<h2><a name="Bridge" id="Bridge"></a>Bridge</h2>
<p>In a <a href="#Target">Target</a>, bridges are used to route between 
 <a href="#Interconnects">Interconnects</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Component" id="Component"></a>Component</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.omg.org/">OMG</a> defines a component as &quot;A 
 modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation 
 is replaceable within its environment. A component defines its behavior 
 in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a component serves 
 as a type, whose conformance is defined by these provided and required 
 interfaces (encompassing both their static as well as dynamic semantics).&quot; 
 A component is an encapsulated unit of functionality with a well-defined 
 interface that allows it to connect to other components, and be independently 
 deployed. Component-based <a href="#Application">application</a>s are 
 defined by assembling components. A component represents a software module 
 (source code, binary code, executable, DLL, etc.) with a well-defined 
 interface. The interface of a component is represented by one or several 
 interface elements that the component provides. Components are used to 
 show compiler and run-time dependencies, as well as interface and calling 
 dependencies among software modules. They also show which components implement 
 a specific class.</p>
<h2>Component Diagram</h2>
<p>Component diagrams are used to model the software architecture of a 
 system. Component diagrams provide a view of the physical software components 
 in the system, their interfaces, and their dependencies. A Component Diagram 
 is created automatically with each model project creation. It is in this 
 diagram that you do your modeling and &quot;work.&quot; For ease of use, 
 you may want to create a diagram for each <a href="#Package">package</a>, 
 which helps you to better organize your elements visually.</p>
<h2>Component Home</h2>
<p>Component Homes are defined for and manage the lifecycle of exactly 
 one type of component. Homes always have monolithic implementations.</p>
<h2><a name="Component Interface"></a>Component Interface</h2>
<p>Defines the provided and required interfaces that the component uses 
 to communicate with its environment. A <a href="#Component Interface">component 
 interface</a> also defines the properties of the component. Properties 
 are the configurable parameters of the component interface, allowing the 
 interface to be configured for a specific use.</p>
<p>In CBD, a component interface can have multiple realizations, hence 
 support multiple different structures to delegate behavior, or different 
 code realizations for different languages.</p>
<h2><a name="Component Realization"></a>Component Realization</h2>
<p>This is a modeling entity that ensures that the messages on the ports 
 of the <a href="#Component Interface">component interface</a> are handled 
 correctly. A component interface is realized by a component realization. 
 A single component interface can be realized by one or more component 
 realizations. Component realizations can contain code and behavior.</p>
<h2>Composite Structure Diagram</h2>
<p>A composite structure diagram shows the internal structure of an <a 
	 href="#Assembly">Assembly</a> by using parts, ports, and connectors. 
 You can use this type of diagram to visually explain the composite parts 
 of the Assembly and to define the behavior and communication between the 
 parts.</p>
<h2>Communication Path</h2>
<p>A connection between two or more physical elements.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.omg.org/">OMG</a> defines a configuration as &quot;a 
 set of default run-time <a href="#Application">application</a> options 
 used to customize non-deployment related application features.&quot;</p>
<h2><a name="Connection" id="Connection"></a>Connection</h2>
<p>A connection is used to describe connections from or to a component 
 port at runtime. A connection is either a communication path among the 
 ports of two or more subcomponents allowing them to communicate with each 
 other, or it is a communication path between an assembly's external ports 
 and an assembly's subcomponents that delegates the external port's behavior 
 to the subcomponent's ports. The endpoint of a connection may also refer 
 to a location outside the assembly.</p>
<h2>Connector Assembly</h2>
<p>An implementation of a connector with multiple connector fragments. 
 They enable designers to express the fragmented implementation of connectors 
 by existing concepts and enable the composition of connectors, which facilitates 
 the development of new connectors.</p>
<h2>Connector Fragment</h2>
<p>A connector will concretely be composed of several Connector Fragments 
 (parts) that &#160;are responsible for realizing a specific piece of the 
 interaction provided by a connector.</p>
<h2>Connectors</h2>
<p>Connectors are used to specify an interaction mechanism between components. 
 Connectors can have ports in the same way as components. They can be composed 
 of simple ports (CCM provides and uses) or extended ports.</p>
<h2>Container Process</h2>
<p>Used in Deployments to define process collocation or process separation 
 of two or more component instances. A container process may also have 
 properties for locality management. Currently the DAnCE properties: CPUAffinity, 
 ProcessName, ProcessPriority as well as LocalityArgument are supported.</p>
<h2>CX Component Diagram</h2>
<p>A CX Component Diagram is created automatically with each model project 
 creation. It is in this diagram that you do your modeling and &quot;work.&quot; 
 &#160;For ease of use, you may want to create a diagram for each <a href="#Package">package</a>—this way you can better visually 
 organize your elements.</p>
<h2>Data Space</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>DDS-Connector</h2>
<p>A DDS4CCM modeling concept used to identify common DDS use patterns 
 with their related ports, DDS entities, and associated QoS settings. At 
 modeling time, DDS-enabled components are said to be &quot;connected&quot; 
 to a DDS-connector through their DDS-ports. At execution time, they interact 
 via DDS, through their collocated Connector Fragment in a connection-less 
 manner.</p>
<h2>DDS Connector Instance</h2>
<p>An instantiation of a DDS-connector. &#160;A relationship that indicates 
 that one component or device depends on a specific property of another 
 component or device.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The deployment brings together the software layer with the platform 
 layer. It models a mapping from software components and the connections 
 between these components to the different platform layers. A deployment 
 can be seen as a model-based representation of an &quot;integration.&quot; 
 &#160;The deployment is the first design element from which code and other 
 related artifacts can be generated for the <a href="#Application">application</a> 
 and optimized for the allocation decisions.</p>
<h2>Deployment Plan</h2>
<p>A mapping of a configured <a href="#Application">application</a> into 
 a <a href="#Domain">domain</a>, this includes mapping monolithic implementations 
 to <a href="#Node">nodes</a>, connections to <a href="#Interconnects">interconnects</a> 
 and <a href="#Bridge">bridges</a>, and requirements to <a href="#Resource">resources</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Domain" id="Domain"></a>Domain</h2>
<p>A target environment composed of independent <a href="#Node">nodes</a>, 
 <a href="#Interconnects">interconnects</a>, <a href="#Bridge">bridges</a> 
 and <a href="#Resource">resources</a>.</p>
<h2>Domain Specialization</h2>
<p>Customization of the CBD development environment is provided by <a href="#Domain">domains</a>, 
 which tailor to the CBD framework for platform intelligence and component 
 model frameworks. Domains also include model transformation engines that 
 correspond to the selected component framework. A domain is an entity 
 that encapsulates specific platform knowledge, component framework information 
 and associated transformation engines.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>Events are named connection points (ports). They may be Event Sinks, 
 into which events of a specified type may be pushed, or Event Sources, 
 that emit events of a specified type to one or more interested event consumers, 
 or to an event channel.</p>
<h2>Execution Environment</h2>
<p>In UML modeling, an execution environment is a type of node that represents 
 a particular execution platform, such as an operating system. You can 
 use execution environments to describe the context in which the execution 
 of a set of deployed components takes place. The properties of an execution 
 environment for a given node/device type will be different and based on 
 both the type and the domain profile in which the execution environment 
 is defined.</p>
<h2>Facets</h2>
<p>Distinct named interfaces provided by the component for client interaction.</p>
<h2>Fragment Assembly</h2>
<p>The realization of a Connector Fragment as an assembly of other Connector 
 Fragments.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Concerns the code that implements a component or device definition or 
 about the components which make up an <a href="#Application">application</a>. 
 Think of this as the executable or shared library that gets loaded to 
 the target platform.</p>
<h2><a name="Interconnects" id="Interconnects"></a>Interconnect</h2>
<p>A target used for the deployment of <a href="#Connection">connections</a> 
 between <a href="#Component">components</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Interface" id="Interface"></a>Interface</h2>
<p>A named set of operations that characterize the behavior of an element. 
 A defined communication boundary.</p>
<h2>Layer</h2>
<p>In CBD, a layer can represent a layer at the software platform, logical 
 platform, and physical platform layer.</p>
<h2>Logical Layer</h2>
<p>Represents the service layer that represents the RTOS, RTOS services, 
 drivers, and middleware layers. It also represents the execution environment 
 such as processes, threads, and virtual machines. The logical layer can 
 consist of multiple layers.</p>
<h2>Message</h2>
<p>An abstraction of an IDL struct used with the DDS DCPS connector to 
 define the type of data of a specific instance of the connector can publish 
 and subscribe. It allows for the modeler to indicate the fields which 
 are the keys of the message.</p>
<h2>Module</h2>
<p>A CORBA module is a namespace that acts as a container for related interfaces 
 and declarations. Modules prevent names defined in the CORBA specification 
 from clashing with names in programming languages and other software systems.</p>
<h2>Monolithic Fragment</h2>
<p>The realization of a Connector Fragment which is not decomposed further.</p>
<h2>Monolithic Implementation</h2>
<p>A component or device's monolithic implementation is an implementation 
 of the component's definition. Usually it is associated with source code 
 or an executable. Instances of either component/device definitions or 
 monolithic implementations are added to an <a href="#Application">application</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Node" id="Node"></a>Node</h2>
<p>In UML modeling, nodes are model elements that represent the computational 
 resources of a system, such as personal computers, sensors, printing devices, 
 and servers. Nodes can be interconnected by using communication paths 
 to describe network structures.</p>
<p>A run-time computational resource that only has at least memory and 
 often processing capability. Run-time implementation objects and components 
 may reside on nodes.</p>
<h2><a name="Package" id="Package"></a>Package</h2>
<p>Packages are used to group model elements. A package can contain multiple 
 different element types. You can use packages to organize your model to 
 enable easier visibility and understanding of model elements. Packages 
 can also be used to model the system architecture, with packages representing 
 different layers. Additionally, the use of packages can make it simpler 
 and faster for you to find elements in the Project Explorer. Packages 
 can have an unlimited number of sub-packages.</p>
<p>Packages are a good way of organizing your model for validation purposes 
 as well. Validating a package also validates everything contained within 
 the package.</p>
<h2><a name="Part" id="Part"></a>Part</h2>
<p>An element within an <a href="#Assembly">assembly</a> that represents 
 a defined element's part within that assembly.</p>
<h2>Physical Layer</h2>
<p>Represents the physical hardware. This layer provides the grounding 
 of the entire model.</p>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>Typical platform layers include a hardware layer composed of different 
 types of processors (GPP, DSP, FPGA), memory buses, and inter connections, 
 and the RTOS layer and middleware layers that provide services to application 
 components. Similarly to applications, platform layers can be individually 
 defined in a component-based manner.</p>
<h2><a name="Port" id="Port"></a>Port</h2>
<p><a href="#Component">Components</a> support a variety of surface features 
 through which clients and other elements of an application environment 
 may interact with a component. These surface features are called ports. 
 The component model supports four basic kinds of ports: Facets, Receptacles, 
 Event sources, and Event sinks.</p>
<h2>Port Type</h2>
<p>Used to define an extended port. Extended ports are groups of single 
 CCM ports (facets or provides ports, and receptacles or uses ports).</p>
<h2>Property</h2>
<p>A Property is a variable that contains a value of a specific type. Configuration 
 Properties are parameters to the Configure and Query operations. Allocation 
 Properties define the capability levels required of a Device by a Resource.</p>
<h2>QoS Policy</h2>
<p>QoS Policies provide control over local and end-to-end properties of 
 DDS entities. Local properties are related to resource usage. End-to-end 
 properties are related to temporal and spatial aspects of the data distribution.</p>
<h2>QoS Profile</h2>
<p>QoS Profiles ease the consistent management of DDS QoS settings. CBDDS supports the following QoS 
 profiles: Data Reader, Data Writer, Participant, Publisher, Subscriber, 
 and Topic.</p>
<h2>Receptacles</h2>
<p>Named connection points that describe the component’s ability to use 
 a reference supplied by some external agent.</p>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<p>Requirement is used to express that the implementation artifact or <a 
	 href="#Connection">connection</a> has requirements that must be fulfilled 
 by resources in the target environment. The resource type must match the 
 type of a resource.</p>
<h2><a name="Resource" id="Resource"></a>Resource</h2>
<p>A feature offered by a <a href="#Node">node</a>, <a href="#Interconnects">interconnect</a> 
 or <a href="#Bridge">bridge</a>. Resource elements express Node, Interconnect, 
 and Bridge features within the target environment. They are matched against 
 implementation requirements at planning time.</p>
<h2>Structural Realization</h2>
<p>A structural realization realizes the structural elements of the component. 
 It realizes this in either structure, code (operations), state machines, 
 mathematical functions or other concepts as defined in the domain.</p>
<p>This realization should be platform independent. That is, able to support 
 all intended platforms for a particular design. The component implementation 
 can be used to add platform specifics if required.</p>
<h2><a name="Target" id="Target"></a>Target</h2>
<p>The Target (or Target Model) describes and manages information about 
 the <a href="#Domain">domain</a> into which <a href="#Application">applications</a> 
 can be deployed. The top-level entity of target information is the <a 
	 href="#Domain">Domain</a>.</p>
<h2>Target Environment</h2>
<p>Also known as <a href="#Domain">Domain</a>. A target environment is 
 composed of independent <a href="#Node">nodes</a>, <a href="#Interconnects">interconnects</a>, 
 <a href="#Bridge">bridges</a> and <a href="#Resource">resources</a>.</p>
